# Atelier Retail Portal
Project Description

Atelier is a modern fashion e-commerce site front end with over 1 million products built with ReactJS and ExpressJS, following a business requirements document and an backend API provided by the project stakeholders. Working as a team of four engineers, the first phase of our development was becoming acclimated to utilizing project management and ticket management tools, including Git Workflow and Trello. For the consistency of the codebase, we implemented Airbnb Style Guide. We practiced agile methodology and held daily standup to keep track of each member's progress on the sub-components of the product. The site has a clean, minimal and modern design. With end users in mind, it also offers a cohesive user experience, high readability and accessibility. Our team challenged ourselves by learning new technologies, including React Hooks and SASS, within a day of the sprint planning session.
